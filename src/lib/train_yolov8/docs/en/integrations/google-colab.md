# Accelerating YOLOv8 Projects with Google Colab

Many developers lack the powerful computing resources needed to build deep learning models. Acquiring high-end hardware or renting a decent GPU can be expensive. Google Colab is a great solution to this. It’s a browser-based platform that allows you to work with large datasets, develop complex models, and share your work with others without a huge cost.

You can use Google Colab to work on projects related to [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models. Google Colab’s user-friendly environment is well suited for efficient model development and experimentation. Let’s learn more about Google Colab, its key features, and how you can use it to train YOLOv8 models.

## Google Colaboratory

Google Colaboratory, commonly known as Google Colab, was developed by Google Research in 2017. It is a free online cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that allows you to train your machine learning and deep learning models on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. The motivation behind developing Google Colab was Google's broader goals to advance AI technology and educational tools, and encourage the use of cloud services.

You can use Google Colab regardless of the specifications and configurations of your local computer. All you need is a Google account and a web browser, and you’re good to go.

## Training YOLOv8 Using Google Colaboratory

Training YOLOv8 models on Google Colab is pretty straightforward. Thanks to the integration, you can access the [Google Colab YOLOv8 Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb) and start training your model immediately. For a detailed understanding of the model training process and best practices, refer to our [YOLOv8 Model Training guide](../modes/train.md).

Sign in to your Google account and run the notebook's cells to train your model.

### Common Questions While Working with Google Colab

When working with Google Colab, you might have a few common questions. Let’s answer them.

**Q: Why does my Google Colab session timeout?**  
A: Google Colab sessions can timeout due to inactivity, especially for free users who have a limited session duration.

**Q: Can I increase the session duration in Google Colab?**  
A: Free users face limits, but Google Colab Pro offers extended session durations.

**Q: What should I do if my session closes unexpectedly?**  
A: Regularly save your work to Google Drive or GitHub to avoid losing unsaved progress.

**Q: How can I check my session status and resource usage?**  
A: Colab provides 'RAM Usage' and 'Disk Usage' metrics in the interface to monitor your resources.

**Q: Can I run multiple Colab sessions simultaneously?**  
A: Yes, but be cautious about resource usage to avoid performance issues.

**Q: Does Google Colab have GPU access limitations?**  
A: Yes, free GPU access has limitations, but Google Colab Pro provides more substantial usage options.

## Key Features of Google Colab
